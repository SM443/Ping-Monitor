## Description
I always use [smokeping](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/) to observe ping results but, I had an [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) wireless router running on my home network. And I wasn't able to run smokeping on it. If you want to save your network's ping output to a file with a timestamp, you can use this with crontab.
